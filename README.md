# Hallie Powell GW Bootcamp Self Assessment


## Self Assessment

Over the course of the final project, my role varied. I started as the "triangle" role with Lara. Our entired team had a great team dynamic, so we did a lot of the work together on zoom. I started by helping to put together the logistic regression model. I also was able to contribute one of the Tableau notebooks, as I utilized our original data to create graphs to see what the data would tell us. I also provided a lot of the technical information, as I have worked in the wine industry for years and have a solid understanding of the information. Finally, I helped write the script for our presentations.

It is difficult to say which roles went to which person, because we worked so closely and seemlessly together. I have not experienced that before in any group project that I can remember. Someone would add some work and then consult the other group members to make sure we all agreed on how it worked and how it looked. It was continuous tweaking of the information, the code, and the presentation to make sure it all flowed together and was exactly what we wanted it to say. We all did research on additional ways to collect data, though none work successful.

My greatest personal challenge in this project was balancing work and classwork. As we encountered the final project, I was given the opportunity to work on a large, intensive project at work. Being able to balance my extra work at my full-time job with the project work required dedication and time management, which was how I overcame the timing issues. I buckled down and was able to contribute in a meaningful way to the project and stay on top of my job.

## Team Assessment

Our group's communication protocol worked very well. We were consistently on slack and zoom. We scheduled calls multiple days each week to make sure we had all the work done, as well as to support any problems that arose within the assignment, such as difficulty finding new data and making the presentation look visually appealing. 

Honestly, I believe we did not have any major challenges with communication. The only challenge was our differing schedules, but we overcame that easily with extra communication, optional meetings, and assigning various things to teammates when they could not attend a meeting. Our team got along very well and became great friends as well as colleagues. 

Our strengths as a team was definitely our ability to divide up the work, while also still having everyone contribute to everything. We found our individual strengths and applied those to the overall project, allowing each member to showcase their skills and giving everyone the option of what they contributed. 

My tips for the new cohort would be to find groupmates with whom you are comfortable and who you know work hard. I'd recommend finding study buddies at the beginning of the course that will be with you every single step of the way. Our group found success because no one let the other people down. We all made sure we had tasks and accomplished them. Consistent calls were a must for our team.

As I said previously, I've never had a group project where every single member of the team worked equally and were this responsible. I loved my team.

## Summary of the Project

We wanted to find out if we could predict whether a wine was red or white using the chemical characteristics of a wine. In addition, we wanted to find out if the myths that exist in the wine world are accurate for the Vinho Verde region of Portugal. This project utilized a logistic regression machine learning model and was able to predict the results with 98.6% accuracy using 13 chemical characteristics. We also were able to confirm the assumptions that red wines often have higher sulphate levels than white wines, and white wines often have more residual sugar than red wines.
